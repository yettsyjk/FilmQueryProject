## Lessons Learned
1. After OCA Exam Prep week, coming back to use my IDE had many epiphany moments regarding classes and object-oriented programming.
1. Introduced to JDBC API
1. PreparedStatments in general seem very fuzzy and require more review.
1. mySQL commands tied to Java8 code and having too many connections to database.
1. This project was a tough one and still fun until the last hour. Fun because there were many ways to properly separate class need to know. I want to come back to this project when I have more time and refactor code.
1. Due to COVID, this course was changed to online format. I feel that I have so many questions and I need to get better at working remotely and asking better questions.

## User Story1
- The user is presented with a menu in which they can choose to:

  - Look up a film by its id.
  - Look up a film by a search keyword.
  - Exit the application.
## User Story2
  - If the user looks up a film by id, they are prompted to enter the film id. If the film is not found, they see a message saying so. If the film is found, its title, year, rating, and description are displayed.
## User Story3
  - If the user looks up a film by search keyword, they are prompted to enter it. If no matching films are found, they see a message saying so. Otherwise, they see a list of films for which the search term was found anywhere in the title or description, with each film displayed exactly as it is for User Story 2.
## User Story4
  - When a film is displayed, its language (English,Japanese, etc.) is also displayed.
## User Story5
  - When a film is displayed, the list of actors in its cast is displayed along with the title, year, rating, and description.

## MVP
